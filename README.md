# üëã Hi there !
Hello my name is Bonnal Natha√´l, currently a DevOps student at Polytech Montpellier üåü. I'm developing various projects around tech, and I'm passionate about IT in areas like cloud, web, research. 

Today I'm putting all my skills to the test at Nudibranches and CrabyWave as a Software Engineer!

You can find projects on my Github which mixes mathematics and programming where I use various languages such as Typescript, Rust, Go or OCaml to put my theoretical knowledge into practice! üöÄ

Currently:
- ‚öôÔ∏è I work for [Nudibranches Technologies](https://nudibranches.tech)
- üìö Student in computer science and mathematics
- üöÄ Collaborator on several open source projects:
  - [Mineral](https://github.com/mineral-dart)
  - [LibreConnect](https://github.com/libreconnect)
  - [Crabywave](https://github.com/crabywave-inc)
  - [Archery](https://github.com/archery-progress)


## What languages do I use ?
I use Rust, Typescript and Go, which form the solid foundation of my web development and application projects. 

With the constant evolution of web development, TypeScript has become a valuable complement to JavaScript. Its static typing offers greater security and makes it easier to maintain large projects, while improving the quality of my code.

Rust, for its part, offers unique guarantees in terms of memory and concurrency security, thanks to its ownership system and borrowing checker. These mechanisms make it possible to avoid classic errors such as data races, use-after-free or memory leaks, without sacrificing performance. It is an ideal language for systems requiring reliability and optimisation, whether for backend applications, low-level programming or distributed systems.

Go, on the other hand, stands out for its simplicity and efficiency. With its powerful garbage collector and goroutines, it offers powerful yet accessible concurrency management. Its pragmatic approach and robust ecosystem make it an ideal choice for the development of APIs, microservices and DevOps tools. Its static typing and compilation speed make it an excellent compromise between productivity and performance.
